# 🧬 Synthetic Promoter Sequence Generator

This project implements a neural network-based agent to **generate synthetic promoter DNA sequences** using a trained autoencoder model. It supports natural language queries that may include promoter design specifications, wet lab experiment suggestions, and related research search.

## 🧠 Overview

- 🧬 Uses a trained autoencoder to generate promoter sequences.
- 🧪 Supports query-driven generation with optional wet lab suggestions.
- 🔍Integrates with LLMs like Claude to search and summarize scientific literature.
